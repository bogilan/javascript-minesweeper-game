# Javascript Minesweeper Game

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.

Gameplay:
The game is played by left-clicking on a square to reveal its contents. If the square contains a mine, the game is over. If the square is empty, a number will be displayed indicating how many mines are in the surrounding squares. Right-clicking on a square will place a flag, which can be used to mark squares that the player believes contain mines.

Difficulty Levels:
The game has three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The board size and number of mines are adjusted based on the difficulty level selected.

Timer and Flag Counter:
The game features a timer that starts when the player makes their first move and stops when the game is won or lost. The game also features a flag counter that displays the number of flags a player has placed on the board.
